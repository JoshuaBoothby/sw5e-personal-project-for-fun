    <h1>Squid pro quo</h1>
    <h2>spq#42069</h2>
    <p>
        The Squid Pro Quo is a ship that is captained by the infamous Captain Squid. The ship is known for its speed and agility, making it one of the most feared ships on the high seas. The Squid Pro Quo is crewed by a group of cutthroat pirates who will stop at nothing to get what they want. The ship is armed with a variety of weapons, including cannons and harpoons, making it a formidable opponent in battle. The Squid Pro Quo is a force to be reckoned with, and any sailor who crosses paths with Captain Squid and his crew would do well to steer clear.
