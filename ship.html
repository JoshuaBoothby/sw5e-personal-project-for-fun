      The Squid Pro Quo is a ship that is captained by the infamous Captain
      Squid. The ship is known for its speed and agility, making it one of the
      most feared ships on the high seas. The Squid Pro Quo is crewed by a group
      of cutthroat pirates who will stop at nothing to get what they want. The
      ship is armed with a variety of weapons, including cannons and harpoons,
      making it a formidable opponent in battle. The Squid Pro Quo is a force to
      be reckoned with, and any sailor who crosses paths with Captain Squid and
      his crew would do well to steer clear.(Filler text)
