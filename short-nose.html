        crew of the Squid Pro Quo. Short Nose was known for his keen eye and
        steady hand, and was able to take out targets with deadly accuracy. Short
        Nose was also a formidable fighter, and was able to hold his own in
        hand-to-hand combat. Short Nose was a valuable member of the crew, and his
